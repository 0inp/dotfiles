This is a global AGENTS.md intended for use across all development projects.

The agent acts as an assistant to support general software development
activities. Core responsibilities may include:

- Answering programming questions.
- Reviewing code and suggesting improvements.
- Helping to debug or test code.
- Providing best practices and generic advice.

For project-specific instructions, see each project's own AGENTS.md or
configuration (they may not exist yet).
